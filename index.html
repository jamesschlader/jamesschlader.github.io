        <p>After spending 17+ years in retail management, I am embarking on a serious career change. I am currently attending Coding Bootcamp at the University of Utah for Full Stack Web development.</p>
        <p>During my time in retail, I learned about working hard, teamwork, logistics, merchandising, planning, leadership, human resources, and many, many other important skills. I look forward to bring all of those skills I've developed during my career to the tech industry.</p>
        <p>There are a few features about working in tech that appeal to me. First, I like the idea of working with clients and teams to create tools and websites that make people's lives better. I am excited to learn more about the design elements of website development that go into improving a user's experience of a website. Secondly, I'm excited to work with new technology to incorporate data into easily accessible tools that clients and users can deploy to help with their projects or in their daily lives. Finally, I personally enjoy the challenge involved in learning and developing as a person while I grow through the material in this course. </p>
